# Differences Between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript:
* TypeScript adds types to JavaScript.This helps find errors early.It makes apps stronger and easier to grow.Interface and type are common in TypeScript.They both define how data looks.
At first, they seem alike.But they have important differences.Knowing these differences helps write good TypeScript code.Good code is clean and easy to change.

# What is an Interface?
An interface defines the structure of an object. It is commonly used with classes or to describe object shapes.

```interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

Interfaces are ideal for describing the shape of an object, especially when working with object-oriented programming.

# What is a Type?
A type is a type alias, which means it can represent not only object shapes but also union types, intersections, primitives, tuples, and more.

```type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```
type is more flexible than interface and can be used to create complex types.


# 🆚 Interface vs Type: Key Differences
| Aspect  | Interface                      | Type Alias                      |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 🔁 Extension                        | Supports `extends` for inheritance | Uses intersection (`&`) for combining types |
| 🔄 Declaration Merging              | ✅ Supported                     | ❌ Not supported                  |
| 🧱 Use Cases                        | Best for object and class structures | Best for primitives, unions, and functions |
| ⚙️ Performance                      | Slightly more optimized during compile | More flexible for complex type definitions |


#✅ When Should You Use What? 

| Scenario                                          | Use          |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Defining object shapes or class contracts         | `interface`  |
| Need union or intersection types                  | `type`       |
| Declaration merging is necessary                  | `interface`  |
| Representing primitives or functions              | `type`       |
| Working with external libraries (often preferred) | `interface`  |
